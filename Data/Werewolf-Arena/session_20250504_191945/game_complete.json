Derek's removal by the Werewolves and the subsequent vote to remove Paul indicate the Werewolves are trying to eliminate threats or blend in. Paul's suspicion of Leah and me for similar statements could be an attempt to divide the Villagers, but Leah's response was consistent with Villager behavior. Ginger, Scott, and Jackson all emphasized the importance of teamwork and vigilance, which is reassuring. I need to watch for players who were unusually quiet or overly aggressive in the debate, as they might be hiding their true roles.
