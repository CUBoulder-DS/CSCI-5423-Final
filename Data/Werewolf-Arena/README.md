Although most of the necessary information can be extracted from the logs, the "discussion length" is not explicitly listed. For clarity, this value corresponds to one of the following two configurations:

- MAX_DEBATE_TURNS = 8, NUM_PLAYERS = 8

- MAX_DEBATE_TURNS = 6, NUM_PLAYERS = 10

These are the only variations we used.
