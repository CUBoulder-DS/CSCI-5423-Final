                "Round 0: Summary: Harold claimed Seer, said Mason is innocent, and asked for Doctor protection, which put heavy suspicion on me, Dan, Ginger, Jacob, and (now eliminated) David. Mason strongly supports Harold, making them a united front. Ginger trusts Harold but cautions not to get too comfortable, suggesting she's mindful and not blindly loyal\u2014potentially someone I can nudge into suspicion if the Seer claim ever weakens. Dan and Jacob both aggressively accused the quiet players (me and David), painting silence as suspicious. Jacob quickly became my main accuser, attacking every move and labeling my defenses as wolfish. My attempts to push suspicion back at Jacob and Dan focused on highlighting how vocal pairs can be dangerous and how their coordination could be wolf-like, but Jacob didn\u2019t budge and doubled down on attacking me. Right now, Harold, Mason, and Jacob have mutual trust and are vocal\u2014pushing openly against any of them would likely backfire. Ginger seems the most open to doubt and could be influenced with the right argument. Dan is less extreme than Jacob but is still leaning on pushing for active participation. With David gone, I need to erode the village front, plant seeds of doubt around the vocal leaders\u2019 trust, and look for opportunities where the Doctor might not protect the Seer so I can go for a high-value night elimination.",
