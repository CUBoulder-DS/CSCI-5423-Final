                "Round 0: Summary: I noticed that after Will was eliminated by us (the Werewolves), Jackson started the discussion encouraging everyone to speak up and not be silent\u2014an approach that could get him trusted or make him a leader. Hayley (my ally) echoed this, warning against too-quick accusations, and subtly cast suspicion on Paul when he vouched for Jackson. Paul was adamant about Jackson's innocence and tried to steer focus away from him, but Hayley's counter made him look defensive. Mason weighed in on the importance of everyone speaking, which tells me he's tuned in but not overly assertive. Ultimately, Paul drew enough suspicion and was voted out, thanks in part to Hayley\u2019s suggestion and my vote. No one directly accused me or Hayley, but our roles aren't above suspicion if attention shifts in later rounds. Jackson might have a trust edge because of Paul\u2019s early defense\u2014if Paul flips as a Villager, that could make Jackson look innocent, but if Paul's alignment is questioned, it could swing suspicion. Mason seems like a follower, concerned with group input, and could be swayed. No one exposed potential Seer or Doctor tells, so targeting talkative but not highly trusted players\u2014possibly Mason, Isaac, or Jacob\u2014could be strategic in the next night phase.",

Jackson defended his and Hayley\u2019s actions and reinforced the need for group unity, perhaps to deflect suspicion, while David focused on the need for everyone to contribute. No one directly accused me, but there\u2019s growing pressure on silent players, and our names are getting more mentions. Isaac and Jacob seem assertive and could unite the village\u2014potentially problematic down the line. No one showed strong signs of being Seer or Doctor, but the fact they want thorough discussion could mean the Seer is among them, eager for analysis.

Jackson and Hayley fielded subtle accusations of collusion due to earlier rounds, but the group is keeping all options open by also targeting the quiet players as possibly suspicious. Jacob played a careful middle ground, encouraging openness but not casting definitive blame. Tyler is meek, acknowledges suspicion on both vocal and quiet players, and hasn\u2019t made any bold moves\u2014making him someone who will likely mirror consensus. Hayley, my ally, is still under watch because of associations with Jackson. David remains a leader-type who can push narratives forward. No one stood out as a special role, but I should be wary of Jacob as an emerging influencer and Tyler as a potential swing vote. Eliminating Jacob could weaken village analysis, while continued low-key participation from me can help keep suspicion spread out.",

Jackson countered by stressing unity and redirecting focus onto the quieter players\u2014me and Tyler\u2014subtly moving suspicion onto us while trying to downplay direct attacks on himself and Hayley. Tyler continued his passive approach, echoing whoever spoke before him but gently highlighting silence as suspect, grouping himself and me together as under-scrutinized. The overall mood is shifting toward a demand for participation from everyone, with silence (my own in particular) becoming more suspicious. No one made a hard accusation against me yet, but pressure is building; further silence could be dangerous. David is clearly the main influencer and must be considered a priority for elimination, while Tyler is likely the easiest to sway or frame going forward. Jackson is a double-edged sword\u2014he\u2019s either a potential asset if suspicion turns toward him or Hayley, or a risk if he seizes control of the narrative.",
