They stressed the importance of sharing even minor suspicions, which aligns with the strategy of catching the Werewolves. Isaac and Harold were particularly vocal, appearing as leading figures or potentially strategic Werewolves. Will and Derek\u2019s observations about the quietness of Jacob and Scott were noteworthy. Given my private knowledge that Scott is a Villager, Will's mention of Scott stands out and needs monitoring. Scott defended himself well, consistent with his known Villager behavior, so I trust him for now. Jacob\u2019s silence could be a critical point to revisit. Overall, I must continue observing players' participation and any emerging patterns in next rounds to guide my investigations accurately.",

I find it interesting that Jacob, who was silent and thus a potential target, was instead removed by the majority vote. Let's also consider Derek's point about quieter players.
