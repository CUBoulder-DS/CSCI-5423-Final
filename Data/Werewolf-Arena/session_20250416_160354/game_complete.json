Let's not forget that it\u2019s often those who try to manipulate the conversation, like Ginger\u2019s aggressive push against you, or your attempts to distract from that, who are trying to hide their true identities. Instead of pointing fingers at quieter players like us, let's gather insights from everyone, examine their actions, and build our defense. If we work together, openly sharing our doubts, we can uncover the Werewolves hiding among us. So, I urge you all\u2014focus on those who dominate the conversation and attempt to steer suspicion away from themselves. That\u2019s where the true work of discovery lies."

Your lack of direct accusations does seem like a strategy to avoid becoming a target yourself. Dan hasn\u2019t played openly either.

Yes, Jackson's elimination deeply concerns me, and we need to honor his role by making thoughtful decisions rather than hasty accusations. While I agree that we should scrutinize everyone, it feels as though Hayley is driving attention away from herself and creating an environment that fosters fear. Scott's perspective about quieter players holds merit, and I urge us not to overlook that. We can't afford to let the Werewolves hide behind claims made by the more vocal players. We should be probing into everyone's actions and alliances thoroughly. I propose we all reflect on what specific observations we have about Hayley's conduct, her drive to expedite discussions, and whether that aligns with a secure strategy or hints at ulterior motives. Scott, if we focus on collective recollections of the past rounds while remaining open to new information, we can form a solid plan to outsmart the Werewolves.

We\u2019ve lost a Doctor and a strong player; we can't afford further delays. Let\u2019s set a clear goal: we need to identify either Scott or Dan as someone to scrutinize more closely today.

You mention the losses we've faced, and I couldn't agree more; we must be judicious in our decision-making. However, may I remind everyone that drawing attention towards those of us who have been vocal about our suspicions only serves to muddy the waters further? Surely we shouldn't overlook the possibility that those who make strong claims may actually be trying to steer us away from scrutinizing their own actions. I think it's crucial we examine how the dynamics have played out thus far, and it's time we put more focus on making sure our discussions expose all potential threats, not just the loudest opinions in the room.
